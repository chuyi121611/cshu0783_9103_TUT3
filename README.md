# Main priject:

1. Hover Effect
   The color of certain rectangles changes when the mouse hovers over them.(only the big rectangles)
2. Dynamic Drawing
   The canvas is redrawn every time the mouse moves by calling the redraw function. This means that the hover effect is real-time, as the canvas recalculates which rectangles should 
   change color based on the new position of the mouse each time it moves.
   
# Quiz 8:

Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

Technique: Double Exposure

Inspiration: The double exposure effect has always been fascinating to me as it merges two seemingly unrelated visuals into one cohesive piece. By overlapping two images, it creates an intriguing juxtaposition and conveys multi-layered stories or emotions. This technique could potentially make our project stand out by adding depth and layers of meaning.

Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

Technique: Blend Modes in CSS

Explanation: CSS provides various blend modes, like multiply, screen, overlay, etc., which can be used to achieve double exposure-like effects in web design. With the right images and the use of these blend modes, we can create a double exposure effect that is responsive and interactive.
